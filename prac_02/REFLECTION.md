# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## What percentage of the lecture videos have you watched so far?

95-100%

## What time, location and duration have you scheduled to watch lecture videos?

Typically, I schedule time to watch lecture videos on Mondays, before the Online Seminars.
I watch them in my home office and usually dedicate around 3-5+ hours on the lecture videos alone to fully engage with the material.
This includes taking notes, pausing for short breaks and reflection, and completing the "Do this now" activities.

## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?

So far, I'm doing well with understanding the content and staying proactive in my learning.
I've made time in my calendar each week to engage with the content and material, which is an active approach I will continue.

## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?

While I've generally stayed on track, this week I fell behind in my usual schedule.
I need to better manage my time during busier weeks and ensure I maintain consistency, especially when unexpected things/issues come up in life.

## What are you currently doing poorly for practicals in this subject that you will change?

At the moment, I find myself not reading the practical instructions correctly, which has already led to small, avoidable mistakes.
I need to slow down, and double-check that my work matches the instructions.

## What are you doing really well for practicals in this subject?

I've been able to understand the practical tasks/what is expected and so far I feel confident in applying what I've learned.
