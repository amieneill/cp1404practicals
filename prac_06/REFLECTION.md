# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## What have you changed about your process in this subject based on your personal reflection?

I've made a conscious effort to carefully read practical instructions/exercises and take more time with tasks.
Which has helped reduce the number of simple mistakes I've been making.

## What do you still need to change in terms of your approach, application, time on task, attitude, etc.?

I need to start my practical work earlier in the week, to allow more flexibility in case of personal issues or other commitments arising, and to ensure i have enough time to complete the exercises without rushing.  

## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?

I've been doing well in understanding and applying new concepts in practicals. 
I have also started taking some time after each practical to reflect on anything I struggled with, to identify the areas I need to improve on. 
This has been helpful in my learning process so far and is something I plan to continue throughout the subject.

## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?

I need to stop underestimating how long the practicals may take, and I also need to start my practical work earlier to avoid any issues. 

## What is one request you have or change you suggest for this subject and/or your IT degree overall?

I think it would be really helpful to see more of the debugging process demonstrated in class using the PyCharm debugger.
